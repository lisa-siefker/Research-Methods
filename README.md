## Background
Colleges across the U.S. are considering updating pandemic era test-optional admission policies. However, experts continue to debate the usefulness and equity of considering standardized test scores in college admission decisions. 
Experts who support mandatory test requirements argue that test scores provide an objective measure of academic readiness and are a useful predictor of college success. Opponents of standardized tests have traditionally argued that test requirements disadvantage low-income and minority students . Specifically, low-income and minority students may not have access to expensive, high-quality test preparation resources. They may also have less time to devote to test preparation since they may have jobs or care for family members. In these situations, high school GPA may be able to more accurately predict college GPA. 
In this study, I examine student data to help answer the question of whether high school GPA is just as effective at predicting college GPA as standardized test scores. Specifically, I separately analyze whether high school GPA and SAT/ACT scores are significant predictors of college GPA across white, Asian, and minority populations. 

## Methods - Data
This study used visualization and statistical analysis to examine data from 1,528 students at a selective four-year U.S. college. For each student, the following relevant information was collected: 
•	Parental education levels for two parents
•	Student race (white, Asian, or minority) 
•	High school weighted GPA, ranging from 0 to 5
•	SAT/ACT score (highest score, where ACT is weighted to equivalent SAT)
•	College program (Arts & Letters, Business & Economics, Math & Science) 
•	College GPA, ranging from 0 to 4
